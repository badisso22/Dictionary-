# Dictionary

In this file, you will find a "dictionary," which is a new concept I learned today by helping a friend with their Python homework.  
I also wanted to make the C equivalent to the dictionary.  

Basically, in these codes, it calculates the number of occurrences in a given sentence/word and stores it in a dictionary.
