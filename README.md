# Dictionary-
in this file you will find a "dictionary", which is a new thing that i learned today by helping a friend with their python homeworks , i also wanted to make the C equivalent to the dictionary .
so basically in these codes , it calculates the number of occurrences in a given sentence/word and stock it in a dictionary
